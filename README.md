# AquariumFilter
Designs for laser-cutting a back sump/aio-style filter for a 15x15x15 cube tank. This includes a 3D-printed spillway to connect the filter to the back of the tank.

The design needs some support underneath the filter, as it holds a little over a gallon of water, meaning it weighs 10+ lbs.
